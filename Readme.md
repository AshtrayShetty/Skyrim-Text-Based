#Text Based RPG
***

This project is just a replica of [Scott Lilly's](https://scottlilly.com/build-a-cwpf-rpg/) "**Super Adventure**" text based RPG, but written by me. I didn't want to copy stuff, so I did this from scratch. Following the same xaml UI model, this basic text based RPG allows features such as:
* Monster Combat
* Player Inventory (to manage and use items for quest and combat)
* Quests
* Trading Items In Trading Shops

Since this is a very basic RPG, there's only one location, very few items and one quest, monster and trader.

I initially intended for this to be a huge world like Skyrim (hence one of the folders is named Skyrim), but I thought I wouldn't be doing Skyrim any justice by creating a bad rip off. Hence, this very basic game. But do enjoy it though!!!
