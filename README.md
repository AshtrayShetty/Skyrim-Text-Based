# Text-Based-RPG
This is a very basic implementation of a text based RPG game I made using WPF in order to learn C# and how to get started with making Windows Desktop applications. It consists of the basic RPG elements:
- Quests
- Monsters
- Reward Items
- Experience Points
- Trading Mechanics

A similar (but more refined in terms of "gameplay") project is covered in [Scott Lilly's Super Adventure](https://scottlilly.com/build-a-cwpf-rpg/).

# Usage
- Open the project in Visual Studio IDE.
- Build the project and run.
